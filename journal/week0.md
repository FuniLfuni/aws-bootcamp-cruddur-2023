# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

## Required Homework

### Installing AWS CLI
I was unable to use GITPOD, so I have configured AWS CLI on my local machine

I followed the instruction on the AWS documentation page of [how to install AWS CLI for windows](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

I copied the following line of code and ran it in the cmd in order to do so.
```
msiexec.exe /i https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi
```
