# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

## Required homework

### Created a Dockerfile into the backend flask folder and pasted the following code

```
FROM python:3.10-slim-buster

#Inside container
#make a new folder inside container
WORKDIR /backend-flask

#Inside container
#install the python images for the app
COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt

#outside container
#Install python libraries fot the app
RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# copies everything in the container
COPY . .

#sets environment variables inside  the container
ENV FLASK_ENV=development

EXPOSE ${PORT}
#python3 -m flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=4567 runs backend via flack modules
CMD [ `"python3"`, "-m" , "flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0", "--port=4567"] 
```


### I ran the following command to build the backend
```
docker build -t  backend-flask ./backend-flask
```

### I then ran the following command to run the container

After running the command, I got a 404 error, and this showed that the backend was running.
![Imagine of the 404 page](asset/week%201%20404.png)

```
docker run --rm -p 4567:4567 -it backend-flask 
```

I changed directories to the Frontend directory and I installed NPM into gitpod using this commands
```
cd frontend-react-js
npm i
```
Then I created another dockerfile in the Frontend-react-js folder, and also pasted this command in the file
```
FROM node:16.18

ENV PORT=3000

COPY . /frontend-react-js
WORKDIR /frontend-react-js
RUN npm install
EXPOSE ${PORT}
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

I ran the following command to build the containers
```
docker build -t frontend-react-js ./frontend-react-js
```
I ran this command to run the container
```
docker run -p 3000:3000 -d frontend-react-js
```

After running the commands, I could see that the frontend was working, however it was not communicating with the backend. So I ran the following command 
```
version: "3.8"
services:
  backend-flask:
    environment:
      FRONTEND_URL: "https://3000-${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_ID}.${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_CLUSTER_HOST}"
      BACKEND_URL: "https://4567-${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_ID}.${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_CLUSTER_HOST}"
    build: ./backend-flask
    ports:
      - "4567:4567"
    volumes:
      - ./backend-flask:/backend-flask
  frontend-react-js:
    environment:
      REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL: "https://4567-${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_ID}.${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_CLUSTER_HOST}"
    build: ./frontend-react-js
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - ./frontend-react-js:/frontend-react-js

# the name flag is a hack to change the default prepend folder
# name when outputting the image names
networks: 
  internal-network:
    driver: bridge
    name: cruddur
```

I right clicked on the docker-compose.yml file and clicked on Compose Up. I clicked on the link again and the frontend and backend were connected.
